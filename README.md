# Bufferoverflow-attack

This is an assignment of the course Advanced System Security .
Originally from http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_16.04/Software/Buffer_Overflow/.
You will follow the instructions of this link(See 'Description' on the link)
Note that there is a litte mistake of the call_shellcode.c, and I have revised and uploaded it.

To setup the working environment:
1. Download the VMware Fusiont,download the SEEDUbuntu16.04.zip from this link: http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/lab_env.html
and unzip it;
2. Open the VMware Fusion and then 'create a custom virtual machine';
3. Select Linux-Ubuntu-Use an existing virtual disk and choose the SEEDUbuntu-16.04-32bit.vmdk from the file unzipped in step 1;
4. Waiting for installation succeesfullt and then you can start your project!

The tasks of this project can found in Homework 2.doc

The report of this project can found in HW2-Report, which shows all the steps,commands,results and explanations you will use or meet in this project.

Through this project you will learn some basic operations and commands of Linux.
You will know how buffer overflow attack works and realize this attack.

In task 4 you may not get the result even wait for a very long executing time, but don't worry it's normal and I have explained it in the report.

This is my first github  projects. Hopefully it will be useful.
